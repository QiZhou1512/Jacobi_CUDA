# Jacobi CUDA implementation


This is an implementation of the popular algorithm Jacobi. The code works stand alone and it is pretty straightforward. Hope it is helping someone as I spend a lot of time searching for a clean implementation.

## Compile

nvcc is needed to compile the code.

```bash
make
```

## Usage

```bash
./Jacobi
```
